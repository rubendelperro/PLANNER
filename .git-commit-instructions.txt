# Commit & Push Instructions

The environment where I ran commands doesn't have `git` available, so I couldn't run the commit for you. Follow these steps in PowerShell after installing Git to create the commit and push the branch.

1) Ensure you're in the repo root:
   Set-Location -Path "C:\Users\nomeg\Documents\RUBEN\PLANNER\1.0"

2) Check current branch (should be `feat/refactor-reducers`):
   git status
   git branch --show-current

3) Stage & commit (powerShell):
   git add -A
   git commit -m "refactor: extract ControlCenter, StoreManager, CategoryManager and move store/category field renderers to components (preserve DOM test hooks)"

4) Push the branch and set upstream (first push):
   git push -u origin feat/refactor-reducers

If you need to install Git on Windows you can use one of the following:
- Winget (Windows 10/11):
  winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget

- Chocolatey:
  choco install git -y

- Or download installer from: https://git-scm.com/download/win

If you want me to open a PR body for you to paste in GitHub, see the file `PR_BODY.md` in the repo root.
