Recommended Codeium (Windsurf) setup for this workspace

Add the following to your VS Code User or Workspace settings (`settings.json`) to enable Codeium inline suggestions and a sensible editor config for this project:

{
"codeium.enabled": true,
"codeium.inlineSuggest.enable": true,
"codeium.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "on",
"codeium.autocomplete": true,
"codeium.showWelcome": false,
"editor.inlineSuggest.enabled": true,
"editor.suggestSelection": "first",
"editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "on"
}

Notes:

- Codeium may require a sign-in or API key depending on your account type. Open the extension UI (Command Palette: "Codeium: Sign In") and follow instructions.
- If you want to keep workspace settings in the repo, temporarily remove `.vscode` from `.gitignore` and commit `.vscode/settings.json` (team decision).
- If Codeium still doesn't provide completions, check the extension's output channel (View -> Output -> select "Codeium") and the Developer Tools Console (Help -> Toggle Developer Tools) for any errors.

If you want, I can create a small helper script to validate whether Codeium is running (checks extension output logs) and print helpful troubleshooting steps.
